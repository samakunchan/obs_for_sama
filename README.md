# OBS MANAGER

A new Flutter project to manage OBS (Open Broadcast Software).

The main idea is to permit any new streamer to get a simple kind of steamdeck on mobile/tablet. <br>

## Requirements

1. You need to get and install a plugin to OBS : https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/releases <br>
It gives you:
- **Ip** server
- **Port** server
- **Password** server

2. You need a **USB - C** connector to connect your device.
NB: Some bugs happen if the connection is not complete or if your computer don't read your device.

## Getting Started

- Press "Settings" button from the app.
- Fill the form datas from OBS>Tools>WebSocket params.
- Press "Connect to OBS".
